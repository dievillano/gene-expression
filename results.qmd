Gene-wise total read counts ranged from `r gene_total_range[1]` to `r gene_total_range[2]` million, with gene `r gene_high_total` showing the highest total count across all samples. A total of `r gene_zero_total` out of `r dim(gene_summary)[1]` genes had zero total counts. Library sizes (i.e., total read counts per sample) ranged from `r sample_total_range[1]` to `r sample_total_range[2]` million, with sample `r sample_high_total` from condition `r condition_sample_high_total` having the largest library. At the condition level, `r condition_high_total` showed the highest total library size (`r condition_total_range[2]` million). A barplot of library sizes across samples is shown in @suppfig-libsize, highlighting variability across libraries and the need for normalisation prior to comparing expression levels.

```

## Pre-processing

After pre-filtering, we retained `r sum(genes_keep)` genes (`r genes_keep_pctg`%), removing `r dim(gene_summary)[1] - sum(genes_keep)` genes and moderately reducing the multiple testing burden for DE analysis. We applied CPM normalisation followed by $\text{log}_2$-CPM, rlog, and VST transformations on the filtered count matrix as described in @sec-norm. @suppfig-boxplots presents boxplots of expression values by sample and condition for each transformation. CPM alone did not stabilise variance, showing skewed distributions with many outliers. In contrast, $\text{log}_2$-CPM, rlog, and VST reduced skewness and improved centring, though some outliers remain. Among these, rlog and VST yielded more uniform distributions across samples compared to the simple log transform, which has known limitations (see @sec-norm). The impact on variance stabilisation is further illustrated in @suppfig-meansd, which plots gene-wise standard deviations against ranked mean expression for each transformation. CPM displays a pronounced variability peak at high expression levels, whereas transformed data show flatter trends, indicating effective variance stabilisation across the expression range.

## Quality assessment and exploratory analysis

PCA was performed on the transformed data of the genes at the 10% of highest variance, yielding an optimal number of three components for all methods except CPM, which retained only one. These components explained `r pca_results_comp_filter_var[2]`%, `r pca_results_comp_filter_var[3]`%, and `r pca_results_comp_filter_var[4]`% of the total variance for $\log_2$-CPM, rlog, and VST, respectively, while CPM explained only `r pca_results_comp_filter_var[1]`%. The scree plot for the rlog-transformed data, shown in @suppfig-scree, illustrates the retained components and their associated variance. The score plots for all retained component pairs in @suppfig-pca-rlog show that replicates from the same condition cluster tightly, indicating high consistency and replicate quality. Since the rlog and VST transformations yield similar explained variance (slightly higher for rlog) we will present results based on the rlog-transformed data from this point forward.

In @fig-pca-rlog-full, subplot A1, samples separate clearly by strain along PC1 and by media condition along PC2. Notably, samples from conditions Y and YC, as well as YE and YCE, cluster closely together, suggesting that EGTA primarily drives the observed separation rather than CFW. This distinction between samples with and without EGTA is more pronounced in the FLC1Δ strain compared to the WT strain. Additionally, a clear separation between samples grown in Y and YC media is observed only for the FLC1Δ strain, indicating a potential interaction between strain and growth media.

Subplot A2 shows that genes CNAG_04283 and CNAG_05602 mainly drive separation toward the WT strain, with CNAG_04283 having the strongest effect as expected since it corresponds to the FLC1 gene itself. Genes CNAG_05662 and CNAG_00588 align closely with FLC1Δ samples, while CNAG_00269, CNAG_01272, and CNAG_04891 appear to contribute to the separation of FLC1Δ samples grown in Y and YC media. Notably, CNAG_01653 is strongly associated with FLC1Δ samples grown with EGTA, suggesting a gene-specific response to this condition.

In subplot B1, samples separate by temperature along PC3, with further strain-specific separation within each temperature group, suggesting a potential interaction between these factors. Subplot B2 reveals that CNAG_04217 drives the separation of FLC1Δ samples at 30°C, while CNAG_02526, CNAG_05662, CNAG_01653, CNAG_00588, and CNAG_04891 contribute to the separation of FLC1Δ samples at 37°C. Conversely, CNAG_03454 and CNAG_05602 drive separation toward WT samples at 30°C, with CNAG_04283 (FLC1 gene) driving separation toward WT samples at 37°C.

Finally, subplot C1 shows temperature-driven separation along PC3 and media-driven separation along PC2. In subplot C2, most genes with strong loadings on these components associate with samples grown at 30°C in YPD, while CNAG_01653 notably contributes to the separation of samples grown at 37°C in YE and YCE media conditions.

![Barplots displaying the top 10 genes with the highest absolute loadings for each principal component.](figures/pca_rlog_load_plot.pdf){#fig-pca-rlog-load}

The results of the pairwise ANOVA tests between the retained principal components and experimental factors (@fig-anova) show that PC1 primarily captures variation associated with the strain condition. PC2 is influenced by all three experimental factors, with the strongest association observed for the media condition. PC3 reflects separation driven by both media and temperature, with the most significant effect corresponding to temperature. The top 10 genes contributing most strongly to each principal component are shown in @fig-pca-rlog-load. Notably, CNAG_01653 exhibits the largest loading magnitude overall, particularly in PC2, and also shows substantial contributions to PC1 and PC3. CNAG_04283, which encodes the FLC1 gene, contributes strongly to both PC1 and PC2. Another prominent gene, CNAG_04891, is among the top contributors to both PC1 and PC2 as well. For PC3, CNAG_03454 shows the highest association, followed by CNAG_04217 and CNAG_00588, the latter also contributing notably to PC1.

## Differential expression analysis

Moving on to model fitting for DE analysis, we observed that the shrunk dispersion estimates aligned well with the mean-dependent trend, indicating a good overall fit (@suppfig-dispersion). This pattern was more consistent in the filtered dataset, whereas in the unfiltered dataset, the trend appeared to be overly influenced by genes with low mean expression levels. 

The contrasts used to test the significance of the model coefficients (excluding the intercept), which correspond to the log-fold changes (LFCs), were labelled to reflect both the main effects and interaction terms included in the DE analysis. Main effects included "Strain (FL)" for the FLC1Δ strain versus WT, "Media (YC)", "Media (YE)", and "Media (YCE)" for the addition of CFW, EGTA, and both to YPD, respectively, and "Temperature (30)" for growth at 30°C versus 37°C. Interaction terms were labelled as "Strain (FL) + Media (YC)", "Strain (FL) + Media (YE)", and "Strain (FL) + Media (YCE)" to capture the combined effect of strain and media condition, and "Strain (FL) + Temperature (30)" for the interaction between strain and temperature. As previously mentioned, our analysis focused on the interaction terms. Unless otherwise noted, results are based on the filtered dataset. 

The (unadjusted) p-value histograms for each contrast display the expected uniform distribution under the null hypothesis, indicating a well-calibrated multiple testing procedure (@suppfig-pvalue). Similar results were observed for the unfiltered dataset (not shown). No outliers were detected in any contrast. However, `r filtered` genes (`r pct_filtered`%) were automatically removed due to low mean normalized counts during the testing of the `r term_filtered` term, as part of `DESeq2`’s independent filtering procedure. MA plots for all contrasts showed a uniform distribution of significantly upregulated and downregulated genes across the range of mean expression levels, suggesting that the procedure is not biased towards highly expressed genes (@suppfig-ma).

![UpSet plot illustrating the intersections between differentially expressed (DE) gene sets across the various contrasts.](figures/upset_plot.pdf){#fig-upset}

The Strain (FL) + Media (YCE) contrast yielded the highest number of differentially expressed (DE) genes (2223), while Strain (FL) + Temperature (30) had the fewest (767) (@tbl-02). All contrasts showed more downregulated than upregulated genes. The highest percentage of downregulated genes was observed in Strain (FL) + Temperature (30) (63.61%), although the contrast with the greatest absolute number of downregulated genes was Strain (FL) + Media (YCE) (1268). The highest proportion of upregulated genes was found in Strain (FL) + Media (YE) (48.02%), while the highest count of upregulated genes overall was again seen in Strain (FL) + Media (YCE) (955) (@tbl-02). The Strain (FL) + Media (YCE) and Strain (FL) + Media (YE) contrasts shared the highest number of differentially expressed (DE) genes in common (712). In total, 3467 uniquely genes were identified as differentially expressed (52.43%), with 180 (2.72%) of them consistently differentially expressed across all contrasts (@fig-upset). Strain (FL) + Media (YCE) also had the greatest number of uniquely identified DE genes (473), i.e. those not shared with any other contrast. This was followed by Strain (FL) + Temperature (30) (401), Strain (FL) + Media (YC) (363), and Strain (FL) + Media (YE) (254).

```

@fig-volcano highlights the top 10 most significant genes for each contrast. Notably, all of the top genes for the Strain (FL) + Media (YC) interaction were downregulated, while all but one of the top genes for the Strain (FL) + Temperature (30) interaction were upregulated. Gene `r repeated_top_genes$gene[1]` appeared most frequently among the top genes, being significantly differentially expressed in all contrasts except Strain (FL) + Media (YC). In addition, genes `r repeated_top_genes$gene[2]`, `r repeated_top_genes$gene[3]`, `r repeated_top_genes$gene[4]`, `r repeated_top_genes$gene[5]`, and `r repeated_top_genes$gene[6]` were consistently ranked among the top genes in both the Strain (FL) + Media (YE) and Strain (FL) + Media (YCE) contrasts.

## Gene expression profiles

![Heatmap of z-scored expression levels for the top 500 most variable genes, annotated by cluster membership and experimental conditions.](figures/heatmap_rlog.pdf){#fig-heatmap}

The optimal number of clusters for the top 500 differentially expressed (DE) genes with the highest variance, determined by the Gap statistic, was four when using z-scores of the rlog-transformed data (@suppfig-gap). The same optimal cluster number was obtained with VST-transformed data, whereas the $\text{log}_2$-CPM transformation resulted in an uninformative single cluster, indicating it may be less effective at capturing meaningful expression patterns in this context.

@fig-heatmap displays a heatmap of the z-scored expression values across the four clusters (labelled 1–4). Because the data are z-scored, positive values indicate expression above the gene’s mean across all conditions, while negative values indicate below-average expression. Cluster 1 is distinct, with genes showing above-average expression in the WT strain and below-average expression in the FLC1Δ strain, particularly under the WT-Y-30 basal condition. In contrast, clusters 2–4 exhibit the opposite pattern, with genes generally showing lower expression in WT and higher expression in FLC1Δ samples, suggesting a strain-specific shift in relative expression. Within these, cluster 2 genes tend to be upregulated in FL-YE-37 and FL-YCE-37 conditions but near or below average in other FLC1Δ combinations. Cluster 3 follows a similar pattern but with elevated expression across a broader range of FLC1Δ conditions. Cluster 4 displays an inverse trend to cluster 2, with higher expression at FL-Y-30, FL-Y-37, and FL-YC-37 conditions.

![Line plot of average z-scored expression for each gene cluster across growth media and temperature conditions, faceted by strain (WT and FLC1Δ).](figures/cluster_profile_plot.pdf){#fig-profile}

@fig-profile illustrates the average z-scored expression patterns of the four gene clusters across media and temperature conditions, shown separately for the WT and FLC1Δ (FL) strains. In the WT strain (top-left panel), cluster 1 genes consistently exhibit above-average expression across all media, with the highest levels observed in the Y media condition. Expression gradually decreases through YC and YE to YCE, with a more pronounced drop from Y to YC than from YE to YCE. Conversely, clusters 2, 3, and 4 show consistently below-average expression in WT, though expression slightly increases with the addition of CFW and EGTA.

For the FL strain (top-right panel), expression patterns invert. Cluster 1 genes are below average in all media and show a marked decrease when CFW and EGTA are present (from Y to YC, and from YE to YCE). Clusters 2 and 3 exhibit progressively increasing expression across media, particularly in YE and YCE. Cluster 2 displays a strong increase with EGTA addition, whereas cluster 3 follows a similar trend but with a less pronounced rise. Cluster 4 shows increased expression upon CFW addition (from Y to YC and from YE to YCE), especially in the Y medium, but has the lowest expression in EGTA-containing growth media.

Regarding temperature, in the WT strain (bottom-left panel), cluster 1 genes remain above average at both 30°C and 37°C, but with reduced expression at 37°C. Clusters 2–4 remain below average, though expression levels increase with temperature. In the FL strain (bottom-right panel), the patterns again invert: cluster 1 genes show near or below-average expression, decreasing further at 37°C. Clusters 2 and 3 show near or above-average expression that increases with temperature, while cluster 4 maintains above-average expression with little change across temperatures.

![Heatmap of log2 fold changes for the top 100 ranked genes across all contrasts, with cluster membership indicated.](figures/heatmap_lfc.pdf){#fig-heatmap-lfc}

## Gene prioritization

To prioritise the most informative genes, we ranked the 500 genes used for clustering based on two criteria: smallest adjusted p-value and largest absolute log2 fold change (LFC), then computed an average rank across both metrics. The top 100 genes according to this combined ranking are shown in @fig-heatmap-lfc, which presents a heatmap of their LFCs across all contrasts alongside their cluster membership. This plot provides a comprehensive summary, integrating statistical significance, expression changes, and clustering results to identify candidate genes of interest. For example, CNAG_04469, which appears near the top of the heatmap, is significantly differentially expressed in the interaction between strain and media at the YE and YCE levels, but not at other contrasts. In both cases, this gene is upregulated in the FL strain relative to the WT-Y-37 reference. As a member of cluster 2, its expression profile aligns with that described for cluster 2 genes in @fig-profile. Additionally, many of the top-ranked genes exhibit significant LFCs specifically in the YE and YCE conditions, with significance in one condition often accompanied by significance in the other.
