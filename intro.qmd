# Introduction

*Cryptococcus neoformans* is a globally distributed fungal pathogen responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths annually, mainly affecting immunocompromised individuals [@may2016cryptococcus]. Treatment options are limited and increasingly compromised by drug resistance, with all major antifungal classes (polyenes, azoles, and pyrimidine analogues) facing challenges related to toxicity and reduced efficacy. This high disease burden, coupled with rising antifungal resistance, highlights an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies.

Recent studies have identified the FLC1 protein as a critical factor in *C. neoformans* stress response and virulence [@stempinski2022cryptococcus]. Because FLC1 homologues are present in other fungal pathogens but poorly conserved in humans, it presents a promising drug target that could enable broad-spectrum antifungal therapies with reduced host toxicity. Motivated by this, the present report analyses transcriptomic data from an experiment by Rachel Murray (Wallace Lab, University of Edinburgh) exploring fungal responses to cell wall stressors—calcofluor white (CFW), EGTA (a calcium chelator), and deletion of FLC1, which is implicated in calcium import. Preliminary observations showed that FLC1 deletion causes abnormal cell wall morphology and lethality at 37°C, effects that EGTA can suppress. This analysis aims to uncover the gene expression changes underlying these phenotypes and provide a statistical foundation for further biological insights.

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a high-throughput technology that enables accurate, genome-wide profiling of gene expression and transcript isoforms at single-base resolution [@wang2009rna]. In the described experiment, RNA-Seq measured transcript abundance across thousands of genes after a 3-hour incubation under varying environmental (growth media and temperature) and genetic (presence or deletion of FLC1) conditions.

Our analysis of this RNA-Seq data had three main goals: (i) assess replicate quality and explore broad expression patterns across samples; (ii) identify genes differentially expressed in response to environmental or genetic changes; and (iii) characterise distinct expression patterns within these differentially expressed genes. These efforts provide robust statistical evidence to guide further biological interpretation and prioritise candidate genes for functional studies of cell wall stress mechanisms in *C. neoformans*.
